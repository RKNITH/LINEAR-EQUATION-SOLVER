        <h1>Linear Equation Solver</h1>
        <p>A linear equation is a mathematical equation that represents a straight line when graphed on a Cartesian
            coordinate system. It has the general form:</p>
        <p>ax + by + cz = d</p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>x, y, and z are variables representing coordinates in space,</li>
            <li>a, b, and c are the coefficients of the variables, and</li>
            <li>d is the constant term.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Linear equations are fundamental in mathematics and have many applications in various fields such as physics,
            engineering, economics, and computer science.</p>
